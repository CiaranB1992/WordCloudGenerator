Father Ted Christmas special: comedy gold, the frankly incensed and mirth
Earlier this year, I wrote a feature called The Secret Lives of the Priests in Father Ted. Of course, no sooner was it published than readers contacted me with more startling revelations about the secret lives of other characters, from the dipsomaniac TV host, Henry “I made the BBC” Sellers, to the lecherous milkman, Pat “Hairy Baby Maker” Mustard, which I am going to share with you today.
But this time, I have dug a little deeper, and invited into my Portaconfessional Father Ted co-creator and co-writer Arthur Mathews, Fr Jack (Frank Kelly), Fr Dougal (Ardal O’Hanlon), Fr Damo (Joe Rooney), Fr Stone (Michael Redmond), Fr Ziggy (Paul Woodfull), singer and heart-throb Eoin McLove (Patrick McDonnell) and Terry McNamee (Gerard Lee), producer of the TV programme Faith of Our Fathers. Arthur and Paul shed new light on how the show came about and they and the others discuss their involvement in it and its legacy.
I also explore what academia has to say about the show – cheers, Google Scholar (Google what now?) – in particular, why some people hated Ted, as well as some appropriately bizarre Father Ted-related research.
