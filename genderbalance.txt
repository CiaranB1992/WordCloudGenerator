Taoiseach wants equal number of men and women in next cabinet
Women voters will be a key demographic in the poll as the country emerges from years of austerity.
“I would like to think that we could have an even split at cabinet level, 50-50 men and women, and I’ve said that before,” Mr Kenny said.
“About 40 per cent of appointments to different boards now are female, which is great, and obviously I have said on many occasions that would be an intention of mine.”
The Taoiseach made the commitment in an interview with political correspondents.
Out of the 15 ministers in Cabinet four are women: Joan Burton, Frances Fitzgerald, Jan O’Sullivan and Heather Humphreys.
At the next election, political parties will be obliged to nominate women as 30 per cent of their candidates. Parties who fail to meet this target will face severe financial penalties in terms of cuts to State funding.
