Running:
This program parses both a text file and a url, extracts the words from it, counts the number of times each 
word is used, outputs the most frequest words as an image file in the source folder with words sized according
to the number of times the word is used. 

Unfinished aspects:
Given more time I would have done the following:
-More words generated by the wordcloud in the image.
-sometimes the words can be halfway off th screen, would fix that to make sure every word was clearly on the screen 
 fully
-Create words on the image file that are vertical aswell as horizontal
-problem with URL file that words can be entirly off the screen if the URL page has thousands of words contained.

Running the program:
-Run the TagCloudRunner class to run it locally though eclipse
- to run in CMD: Navigate to bin folder where the jar file is found then use this:
 java -cp ./wordcloud.jar ie.gmit.sw.WordCloudRunner
